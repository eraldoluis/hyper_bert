# Unsupervised Hypernym Discovery using BERT

We are developing methods for unsupervisedly discovering hyponym-hypernym relations from large text corpora in Portuguese.
Initially, we explored the DIVE (Distributional Inclusion Vector Embedding) method (Chang et al., 2018).
Now we are developing a new method based on a combination of BERT and Hearst patterns (Hearst, 1992).
